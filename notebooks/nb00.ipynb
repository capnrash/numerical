You shouldn't remain stuck for more than a few minutes on the questions in this assignment, so ask a neighbor or an instructor for help.

    "In the question above, you accessed variables within the `math` module. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Modules** also define **functions**.  For example, `math` provides the name `sin` for the sine function.  Having imported `math` already, we can write `math.sin(3)` to compute the sine of 3.  (Note that this sine function considers its argument to be in [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian), not degrees.  180 degrees are equivalent to $\\pi$ radians.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 9.** A $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ radian (45-degree) angle forms a right triangle with equal base and height, pictured below.  If the hypotenuse (the radius of the circle in the picture) is 1, then the height is $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$.  Compute that value using `sin` and `pi` from the `math` module.  Give the result the name `sine_of_pi_over_four`.\n",
