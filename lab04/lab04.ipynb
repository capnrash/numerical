    "Welcome to Lab 04! Throughout the course you will complete a lab assignments like this one. You can't learn technical subjects without hands-on practice, so labs are an important part of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborating on labs is more than okay -- it's encouraged. You should rarely remain stuck for more than a few minutes on questions in labs, so ask a neighbor or an instructor for help. Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it. You should **not** just copy/paste someone else's code, but rather work together to gain understanding of the task you need to complete. \n",
    "\n",
    "In today's lab, you'll learn about root finding algorithms. \n",

    "To receive credit for a lab, answer all questions correctly and submit before the deadline.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Collaboration Policy:** Labs are a collaborative activity. While you may talk with others about the labs, we ask that you **write your solutions individually**. If you do discuss the assignments with others **please include their names below** (it's a good way to learn your classmates' names).\n",

    "## 0. Python Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write a very simple function that converts a proportion to a percentage by multiplying it by 100.  For example, the value of `to_percentage(.5)` should be the number 50 (no percent sign).\n",
    "\n",
    "A function definition has a few parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `def`\n",
    "It always starts with `def` (short for **def**ine):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Name\n",
    "Next comes the name of the function.  Like other names we've defined, it can't start with a number or contain spaces. Let's call our function `to_percentage`:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def to_percentage\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Signature\n",
    "Next comes something called the *signature* of the function.  This tells Python how many arguments your function should have, and what names you'll use to refer to those arguments in the function's code.  A function can have any number of arguments (including 0!). \n",
    "\n",
    "`to_percentage` should take one argument, and we'll call that argument `proportion` since it should be a proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion)\n",
    "    \n",
    "If we want our function to take more than one argument, we add a comma between each argument name. Note that if we had zero arguments, we'd still place the parentheses () after than name. \n",
    "\n",
    "We put a colon after the signature to tell Python it's over. If you're getting a syntax error after defining a function, check to make sure you remembered the colon!\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Documentation\n",
    "Functions can do complicated things, so you should write an explanation of what your function does.  For small functions, this is less important, but it's a good habit to learn from the start.  Conventionally, Python functions are documented by writing an **indented** triple-quoted string:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Converts a proportion to a percentage.\"\"\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Body\n",
    "Now we start writing code that runs when the function is called.  This is called the *body* of the function and every line **must be indented with a tab**.  Any lines that are *not* indented and left-aligned with the def statement is considered outside the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes about the body of the function:\n",
    "- We can write code that we would write anywhere else.  \n",
    "- We use the arguments defined in the function signature. We can do this because we assume that when we call the function, values are already assigned to those arguments.\n",
    "- We generally avoid referencing variables defined *outside* the function. If you would like to reference variables outside of the function, pass them through as arguments!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's give a name to the number we multiply a proportion by to get a percentage:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Converts a proportion to a percentage.\"\"\"\n",
    "        factor = 100\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `return`\n",
    "The special instruction `return` is part of the function's body and tells Python to make the value of the function call equal to whatever comes right after `return`.  We want the value of `to_percentage(.5)` to be the proportion .5 times the factor 100, so we write:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Converts a proportion to a percentage.\"\"\"\n",
    "        factor = 100\n",
    "        return proportion * factor\n",
    "        \n",
    "`return` only makes sense in the context of a function, and **can never be used outside of a function**. `return` is always the last line of the function because Python stops executing the body of a function once it hits a `return` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**  `return` inside a function tells Python what value the function evaluates to. However, there are other functions, like `print`, that have no `return` value. For example, `print` simply prints a certain value out to the console. Be aware that `return` and `print` are **very** different. "

    "## 1. Introduction to Numerical Root Finding\n",
    "\n",
    "The topic of numerical root finding really boils down to approximating the solutions to equations without using all of the by-hand techniques that you've learned up to this point in high school. The down side to everything that weâ€™re about to do is that our answers are only ever going to be approximations. Mathematicians love (and I mean love) exact values. Think about values like $\\pi$, $e$, $\\sqrt 2$ and all those values for sine and cosine you may have been forced to memorize from special right triangles and the unit circle. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

If we want to write a function that returns the real roots of a quadratic equation we need to consider the following cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $b^2 < 4ac$, then roots are complex (not real). For example, roots of $x^2 + x + 1$ are $\\frac{-1 + i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\\frac{-0.5 - i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n",
